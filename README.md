# StockWatcher

## The Problem
Stock watchlists, while very commonly-used tools in the finance world, are
generally limited in their functionality. A user is able to view certain
attributes of a stock but often has to use other tools for "stock-screening-
style" analysis or for profit/loss analysis on a portfolio.

## A New Approach
StockWatcher is an application that goes beyond the conventional stock watchlist
to offer the user a wider range of capabilities:
+ log in with your Facebook account
+ add stocks to the list
+ view trading info (ticker, etc.) for each stock
+ view current-day and year-to-date trading data for each stock
+ view StockWatcher recommendations based on each stock's relative performance
+ record a purchase for each stock, giving the quantity and purchase price
+ track performance of each purchase over time, including profit/loss and comparison to S&P 500 performance
